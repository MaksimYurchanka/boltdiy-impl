# bolt.diy-impl (Layer 2) - Integration API

This project implements the Integration Layer (Layer 2) of the AIACD 4-layer architecture, serving as the critical bridge between the Orchestration Layer (Layer 1) and the Implementation Environment (Layer 3).

## Key Responsibilities:
- Implement RESTful API endpoints for bidirectional communication
- Handle authentication between layers with API key validation
- Process task submissions from Layer 1 to Layer 3
- Return implementation results from Layer 3 to Layer 1
- Track token usage and efficiency metrics
- Manage file operations across the system

## Implementation Focus:
- API-first design with clear endpoint specifications
- Supabase integration for data persistence
- Secure authentication and request validation
- Comprehensive error handling with standard response formats
- Task queuing and status tracking
- Token usage tracking for efficiency measurement

## Current Priorities:
- Core task management endpoints (create, status, retrieve, modify)
- Authentication middleware implementation
- bolt.diy-standalone client for Layer 3 communication
- Supabase integration for data persistence
- Token tracking metrics system
