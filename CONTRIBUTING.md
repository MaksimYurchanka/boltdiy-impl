## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers understand your report, reproduce the issue, and find related reports.

Before creating bug reports, please check the issue tracker as you might find that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**.
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots or animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.
* **If the problem is related to performance or memory**, include a CPU profile capture and a memory heap snapshot with your report.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality.

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**.
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
* **Include screenshots or animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to.
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most users.
* **List some other applications where this enhancement exists.**
* **Specify which version you're using.**

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain code quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible solution
- Enable a sustainable system for maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in the template
2. Follow the style guides
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all status checks are passing

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.
